# Google Cloud Functions Course
## Starting a project
To start a project in Google Cloud, we can go to the [Firebase Console](http://console.firebase.google.com) or
create it from [Google Cloud Platform](heep://console.google.cloud).
## Creating a virtual environment
first we have to install 'python3-venv' with the following command
```commandline
sudo apt python3-venv
```  
Then, we execute the following command:
```commandline
python3 -m venv venv
```
To activate the virtual environment we do:
```commandline
source venv/bin/activate
```
In order to add new packages to our virtual environment 
we create a file called 'requirements.txt' amd execute the following command:
```commandline
pip install -r requireents.txt
```
